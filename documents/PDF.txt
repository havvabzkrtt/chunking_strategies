Abstr act
Backgr ound: Exergames have attracted growing interest in the prevention and treatment of neurocogniti ve disorders. The most
effective exergame and training components (ie, exercise and training variables such as frequenc y, intensity , duration, or volume
of training and type and content of specif ic exergame scenarios) however remain to be established for older adults with mild
neurocogniti ve disorders (mNCDs). Regarding the design and development of novel exergame-based training concepts, it seems
of crucial importance to explicitly include the intended users’ perspecti ve by adopting an interacti ve and participatory design that
includes end users throughout different iterati ve cycles of development.
Objecti ve: This study aimed to determine the capabilities, treatment preferences, and motivators for the training of older adults
with mNCD and the perspecti ves of individuals on training goals and settings and requirements for exergame and training
components.
Methods: A qualitati ve study including expert focus groups and individual semistructured in-depth patient intervie ws was
conducted. Data were transcribed to a written format to perform qualitati ve content analysis using QCAmap softw are.
Results: In total, 10 experts and health care professionals (80% females) and 8 older adults with mNCD (38% females; mean
age 82.4, SD 6.2 years) were recruited until data saturation was observ ed.
Conclusions: The psychosocial consequences of patients’ self-percei ved cogniti ve deterioration might be more burdensome
than the cogniti ve changes themselv es. Older adults with mNCD prefer integrative forms of training (such as exergaming) and
are primarily motivated by enjoyment or fun in exercising and the effectiveness of the training. Putting the synthesized perspecti ves
of training goals, settings, and requirements for exergames and training components into conte xt, our considerations point to
opportunities for impro vement in research and rehabilitation, either by adapting existing exergames to patients with mNCDs or
by developing novel exergames and exergame-based training concepts specif ically tailored to meet patient requirements and
needs.

RenderXIntroduction
Backgr ound
The normal aging process is associated with a decline in physical
and cogniti ve abilities [1,2]. When the cogniti ve decline exceeds
the normal age-related cogniti ve decline but is not severe enough
to interfere with independence in activities of daily living, it
can be classif ied as “mild cogniti ve impairment” (MCI),
representing an intermediate stage of cogniti ve impairment
between the normal aging process and dementia [3-9]. The
condition MCI has evolved over the last decades [5] and has
recently been incorporated in the latest Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) and the
International Classif ication of Diseases 11th Revision, referred
to as mild neurocogniti ve disorder (mNCD) [7,9-11]. The
prevalence of mNCD increases with age, while the incidence
of mNCD and the progression to dementia is expected to rise,
largely because of the globally growing life expectancies and
sedentary lifestyles [3,5,12-15]. As currently no effective
pharmacological interv entions for patients with mNCD exist
[16], alternati ve options to prevent and treat neurocogniti ve
disorders are needed. Targeting modif iable risk factors in midlife
may hold promise for mitig ating or even preventing
neurocogniti ve disorders in later life [17-21]. The modif iable
risk factors for mNCD include the presence of vascular risk
factors (ie, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or strok e) [22-24] or
a physically or cogniti vely sedentary lifestyle [25,26].
Consequently , changes in lifestyle that increase physical and
cogniti ve activity and reduce vascular risk factors are protecti ve
against cogniti ve decline [27-35].
Exergames have gained growing interest to prevent and treat
neurocogniti ve disorders [36-38]. “Exergaming is defined as
technology-dri ven physical activities, such as video game play,
that requires participants to be physically active or exercise in
order to play the game” [39]. One of the major advantages of
exergame-based training is that it is widely accepted by
individuals with neurocogniti ve disorders. In addition, it
increases training adherence and engagement by facilitating
training motivation and satisf action [40], which in turn may
have a positi ve effect on the effectiveness of impro ving
cogniti ve functioning [41]. Furthermore, exergames can be used
as a form of simultaneous cogniti ve-motor training with
incorporated cogniti ve task demands [42]. Meta-analytic
evidence suggests that simultaneous motor -cogniti ve training
is the most effective type of training for impro ving cognition
in health y older adults (HOA) [43,44] and older adults with
mNCD [44-46]. For exergames specif ically , a recent systematic
review synthesized evidence from low risk of bias studies
showing that there were consistent positi ve effects favoring
exergaming in people with mNCD and dementia [40].
Nonetheless, it is currently difficult to draw reliable conclusions
about the effectiveness of exergaming in preventing and treating
neurocogniti ve disorders because of the substantial variations
in the exergame-based training used. Therefore, further
investig ations are needed for the establishment of effective
exergame and training components (ie, exercise and training
variables such as the frequenc y, intensity , duration, or volumeof training and the type and content of specif ic exergame
scenarios) for cogniti ve functioning that can be applied with
confidence in evidence-based exergame interv entions [36].
Regarding the design and development of novel exergames, it
seems crucial to explicitly include the intended users’
perspecti ves [47]. Taking the characteristics, needs, and
experiences into account should ensure adequate use and
therefore the effectiveness of the solution. Baquero et al [48]
pointed out that an end user–centered methodological design is
most often adopted in the development of computer -based
training programs for cogniti ve rehabilitation of older adults
with neurocogniti ve disorders (NCDs). In an ideal case, this
process fulfills the international standards for the development
of programs including (1) understanding and specifying the
conte xt of use (type, characteristics and tasks of users, and
physical or social environment), (2) specifying the user
requirements, (3) producing design solutions, and (4) evaluating
the design [48,49]. So far, only half of the studies reporting
computer -based interv entions took the standard “specif ication
of user requirements” into account [48]. This has led to the
recommendation that future studies in this field should use an
interacti ve and participatory design that explicitly includes end
users throughout different iterati ve cycles of development [48].
In short, it is important to systematically and thoroughly
investig ate the specif ic user requirements and preferences for
an exergame-based training concept before it is designed and
developed.
Objecti ves
This study aimed to determine the capabilities, treatment
preferences, and motivators for the training of older adults with
mNCD and the perspecti ves of individuals on training goals
and settings and requirements for exergame and training
components.
Methods
Overview
This study is part of the national project “Brain-IT ,” which
began in August 2020 in Switzerland. The aims of the overall
project are (1) to determine the most suitable components for
exergame-based training in older adults with mNCD; (2) to
explore novel strate gies for a real-time adapti ve exergame
system to individually tailor exergame demands according to
users’ physical or cogniti ve capabilities; (3) to incorporate the
acquired knowledge into an exergame-based training concept
with the aim of halting or reducing cogniti ve decline and
impro ving quality of life; and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness
of the resulting training interv ention in older adults with mNCD.
The project is guided by a theoretical frame work that provides
specif ic guidance in the design, development, and evaluation
of exergames for older adults, the “Multidisciplinary Iterati ve
Design of Exergames (MIDE): A Frame work for Supporting
the Design, Development, and Evaluation of Exergames for
Health” [50], which provides specif ic guidance in the design,
development, and evaluation of exergames for older adults. This
study is part of the first phase of the project, with the aim to
specify a “set of design requirements that includes design
considerations, accessibility recommendations, user modeling

RenderXelements, and technological reflections to be followed in the
design and development phase ”[47,50], and it was combined
with an extensi ve literature review and reflections on technology
scoping and sustainability strate gy (see steps 4 and 5 of phase
1 of our recently published methodological paper [47]). For the
project, the exergame device “Senso (Flex)” (Dividat AG) was
preselected on the basis of (1) our previous research, (2) because
this device has already been shown to be feasible and
well-accepted in geriatric patients [51] and patients with major
neurocogniti ve disorder [52], and (3) because it is already widely
used (and therefore available more widely and for longer term
by end users and health care institutions) for motor -cogniti ve
training within geriatric populations, physiotherapies, or
rehabilitation clinics in Switzerland. On this basis, this
qualitati ve study was designed to achie ve the defined objecti ves
in general; in addition, it also aimed to collect evidence about
the previous experiences of experts or health care professionals
with different exergame systems [including the “Senso (Flex)”].
In this way, the project team wanted to collect evidence to make
an informed decision whether the specif ic exergame device was
suitable for the project, what possible modif ications might be
needed to optimize the exergame experience for patients with
mNCD, and whether and what alternati ve exergame devices are
suggested by the experts (see subsections of “(T2) Treatment
Experience and Preferences—Pre vious Experiences with
Exergames (‘Senso’ specif ically)” and “(T5) Exergame and
Training Components—Ex ergame System and Content” in the
focus group discussions). Other than parts of these 2 sections
that include device-specif ic findings, none of the remaining
sections in this manuscript are device specif ic.
Study Design
A qualitati ve study was conducted between November 2020
and January 2021, including expert focus groups and patient
intervie ws; both were organized as semistructured, in-depth
intervie ws. Semistructured, in-depth intervie ws are the most
widely used intervie wing format for qualitati ve research and
are generally organized around a set of predetermined
open-ended questions, with additional questions and discussion
points emer ging from the dialogue [53]. The study was planned
and reported in accordance with the “consolidated criteria for
reporting qualitati ve research (COREQ)” [54].
The MIDE Frame work [50] guided our approach. On the basis
of this frame work, we integrated multiple stakeholders into the
design and development process including exergaming
researchers, clinical experts with different backgrounds, a
compan y representing the exergaming industry , and the end
users.
Ethics Approval
All the study procedures were performed in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol (not registered)was appro ved by the ETH Zürich Ethics Commission (EK
2020-N-154). All interested individuals were fully informed of
the study procedures. The expected benef its and risks of the
study were explained by the study investig ator, who was also
able to answer open questions and clarify individuals’
uncertainties. It was further verified that withdra wal was
permitted at any time during the study without providing any
reason. After sufficient time, suitable individuals willing to
participate in the study provided written informed consent and
were included in the study . No compensation was provided to
the participants.
Participants
Experts
Recruitment aimed at including experts and health care
professionals experienced with exergame training of older adults
with mNCD, preferably (but not necessarily) with the exergame
training system “Senso (Flex)” or similar . For this purpose,
Dividat AG was asked to provide a contact list of 10 to 15
external experts and health care professionals with a variety in
age, sex, educational level, and experience in therap y of older
adults with mNCD, who are not emplo yed by Dividat AG or
had recei ved any funds from Dividat AG for their work. All
recommended experts and health care professionals were
contacted via email between November and December 2020.
By applying broad inclusion criteria, a rich spectrum of experts
and health care professionals were considered in the study ,
which in turn will foster the usability of the resulting program
in clinical practice. The specif ic eligibility criteria comprised
the following aspects: (1) experts or health care professionals
(eg, physical therapists, movement therapists,
neuropsychologists, or researchers experienced with exergames)
experienced with exergame training or with older adults with
mNCD; (2) German or English speaking; and (3) age ≥18 years.
There were no specif ic exclusion criteria.
Older Adults With mNCD
Older adults with mNCD were consecuti vely recruited between
November 2020 and January 2021 in collaboration with health
care institutions and (memory) clinics in the larger area of
Zürich. Leaflets and study information sheets containing
researchers’ contact details were handed out to suitable patients
by their therapists. Suitable patients were identif ied from
medical records and patient registries of memory clinics or from
diagnostics that had just been performed. Interested patients
were contacted by the research team by telephone or email to
clarify or obtain further information about the study procedures
and to register interest in participating in the study .
Subsequently , all patients were fully informed about the study
procedures in a face-to-f ace meeting at the patient’ s homes. In
addition, patients of interest were screened for eligibility . The
eligibility criteria are presented in Textbox 1.

Procedur es and Data Collection
Expert Focus Groups
The expert focus groups were moderated by the first author
(PM) into groups of up to 5 experts. The moderator was a male
doctoral student with a master’ s degree in Health Sciences and
Technology (ETH Zürich, Switzerland), who was trained for
qualitati ve research. Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, all
focus group sessions were held as web-based meetings in the
form of Zoom sessions (Zoom Video Communications), took
approximately 60 to 90 minutes to complete, and were audio
recorded. Each session started with a short presentation of the
background and overall aim of the project. Subsequently , the
aim of this study was presented before starting the focus group
discussions. The focus group discussions were organized as
semistructured, in-depth intervie ws with open-ended questions
to enable open conversations [53]. The exchange was conducted
following a focus group guide (Multimedia Appendix 1)
structured along 5 topics, each consisting of multiple key
questions. First, the capabilities of older adults with mNCD
were discussed, in continuation with insights into training goals
and outcomes in the perspecti ve of patients as well as therapists.
Thereafter , the exchange focused on treatment experiences and
preferences as well as motivators for training of older adults
with mNCD. Finally , the requirements and optimal components
of the exergame-based training were critically discussed. To
focus the moderator’ s attention on participants’ verbal and
nonverbal communication and because handwritten notes during
intervie ws are considered relati vely unreliable, no notes were
taken during the focus group sessions [57].
Patient Interviews With Older Adults With mNCD
The patient intervie ws were conducted individually with each
patient by the first author (PM) and either took place at ETH
Zürich (Institute of Human Movement Sciences and Sport,
Leopold-Ruzicka-W eg 4, 8093 Zürich) or at the patients’ homes,
depending on the patients’ preferences. The intervie w sessions
were held face-to-f ace in a quiet room with no one presentbesides the intervie wer, the patient, and, if requested, a care
professional or partner as personal support for the patient. We
did not set a time limit for the intervie ws but gave all
participants enough time to share their views on the topics
discussed. On average, each session took approximately 20 to
30 minutes to complete and was audio recorded. Before starting
the intervie w, the background and overall aim of the project as
well as the aim of this study were explained to each patient.
The intervie ws were organized as semistructured, in-depth
intervie ws along an intervie w guide (Multimedia Appendix 1)
[53]. The intervie w guide was not pilot-tested, as it was
developed by the first author (PM) in collaboration with the
second author (MA), an experienced clinical neuropsychologist.
After questioning the patients’ capabilities as well as their
previous treatment or training experience and preferences, the
intervie w continued with questions about motivators for training
and the preferred components of exergame-based training.
Open-ended questions were asked to enable an open
conversation [53]. To focus the moderator’ s attention on
patients’ verbal and nonverbal communication, no notes were
taken during the intervie ws [57]. Finally , the intervie wer was
prepared to tailor the intervie w questions and communication
style to the patients’ capabilities, and in case of higher levels
of impairment, to adopt strate gies suggested to optimize
communication with patients with NCDs [58,59].
Sample Size
The intended sample size was set at approximately 5 to 10
experts for the focus group sessions and 5 to 10 older adults
with mNCD for the patient intervie ws; however, study
participants were consecuti vely included until data saturation
was reached [60].
Data Analysis
First, all audio files were transcribed in written format in
Microsoft Word in pseudon ymized form. The transcripts were
not returned to the participants for corrections or comments. To
explore the perspecti ves of patients and experts or health care
professionals, a qualitati ve content analysis was performed
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 4 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616

XSL•FO
RenderXaccording to Mayring et al [61,62] using QCAmap softw are
[62-64]. The first step in the analysis involved repeated readings
of the transcripts and listening to the original audio files to gain
a better understanding of the conversation content. Second, the
type of analysis (ie, category assignment procedure) was
predef ined for each of the research questions (ie, key questions
of the intervie w guide). In case of an inducti ve category
assignment procedure, a selection criterion and level of
abstraction were defined for each of the research questions. For
deducti ve category assignments, each research question was
operationalized into categories, and a corresponding coding
guideline (ie, category label, category definition, anchor
example, and coding rules) was formulated. On the basis of this,
all transcripts were coded line-by-line (ie, including a revision
of the category system after a pilot loop). Subsequently , each
resulting list of categories was grouped into main categories,
and inter- and intra-agreement checks were performed. Finally ,
the results of each key question were analyzed along the
structure (including predetermined themes and topics) of the
intervie w guide that was created according to the guidelines of
the MIDE Frame work [50]. Thus, the results were structured
and analyzed in 2 main themes and 5 topics. First, the section
“user modeling” that included 3 topics: (T1) capabilities of older
adults with mNCD, (T2) treatment experiences and preferences,
and (T3) motivators for training. Second, “therapeutic needs, ”
including (T4) training goals and outcomes and (T5) exergame
and training components. Within the topic “(T1) capabilities of
older adults with mNCD, ” the described cogniti ve capabilities
and difficulties were classif ied into the key neurocogniti ve
domains (as defined by Sachde v et al [10]) in line with DSM-V
[9] on agreement between the first (PM) and second author
(MA; an experienced neuropsychologist). Within the topic “(T3)
motivators for training, ” the motivators for training were coded
and analyzed against the background of the “Self-determination
Theory” [65]. The Self-determination Theory [65] accounts for
the quality of different levels of motivational regulation in
physical activity settings. It is considered useful to gain a better
understanding and promote training motivation, enjoyment, and
adherence and has demonstrated considerable efficacy in
explaining exercise motivation and behavior [66-70]. Data fromthe qualitati ve content analysis were combined with quantitati ve
data (ie, frequenc y of various statements [f] and in the case of
patient intervie ws, the proportion of patients making a statement
[in %]) [60]. The coding and data analysis process was
cross-check ed to enhance the credibility of the analytic
procedure [60].
Results
Participants
In total, 11 external experts and health care professionals were
contacted by the first author (PM). All experts responded and
were interested in participating. Two experts could not
participate in the focus group sessions because of time
constraints. According to the “inte grative” contrib ution of the
MIDE Frame work, “perspecti ves of various stakeholders (e.g.,
industry partners, data analysts, health care professionals) are
considered in the process of designing and developing
exergames ”[50]. In accordance with this, the founder of Dividat
AG was involved in one of the focus group discussions as an
industry representati ve. In total, 10 experts and health care
professionals (80% females) participated in 1 of the 5 focus
group sessions until data saturation was observ ed and further
recruitment was terminated. The focus group sessions were
conducted in groups of between 1 (k=3) and 3 (k=1) experts
(median 1.5) and the moderator (PM). The professional
backgrounds of the experts and health care professionals
included exergaming researchers (n=4), physical and
occupational therapists (n=2), neuropsychologists (n=2), project
manager therap y (n=1), and founder of an exergaming compan y
(n=1).
For the patient intervie ws, 8 patients (38% females; mean age
82.4, SD 6.2 years; mean level of cogniti ve functioning,
measured by the German Version of the Quick Mild Cogniti ve
Impairment Screen [55], 56.0, SD 8.2) were invited and
intervie wed until data saturation was observ ed and further
recruitment was terminated. None of the patients refused to
participate or dropped out of the study after providing their
written informed consent. The demographic characteristics of
the patients are summarized in Table 1.

Qualitati ve Content Analysis Results
T1: Capabilities
The experts described a large variety of impairments observ ed
in older adults with mNCD. The most frequently described
impairments referred to cogniti ve functioning (f=43), including
impairments in the following neurocogniti ve domains: executi ve
function (f=23), comple x attention (f=11), learning and memory
(f=7), visuospatial skills (f=2), language (f=1), and social
cognition (f=1). These cogniti ve changes were also described
as affecting psychosocial factors (f=22), mainly by causing
psychological distress (f=9) and feelings of insecurity (f=2),
leading patients to try to hide their impairments from others
(f=2). In addition, an increased fall risk (f=9) and reduced
physical resilience (f=7) were observ ed. Although experiencing
difficulties in activities of daily living (ADLs; f=1), patients
were described as maintaining their functional independence in
ADL (f=2).
In line with the experts’ viewpoint, cogniti ve deterioration (f=22,
n=7, 88%) was frequently described by the patients, mainly
affecting learning and memory (f=11, n=4, 50% of patients),
executi ve function (f=6, n=4, 50% of patients), and comple x
attention (f=5, n=2, 25% of patients), whereas only minor
restrictions in physical capabilities and mobility were mentioned
(ie, impaired balance, [f=2, n=2, 25% of patients], reduced gait
speed [f=1, n=1, 13% of patients], increased fall risk [f=9, n=5,
63% of patients], fatigue [f=6, n=3, 38% of patients], and joint
pain [f=2, n=2, 25% of patients]). ADLs remained preserv ed in
all patients, but the need for coping strate gies was mentioned
by 4 patients (50%) to be able to preserv e ADLs. From the
patients’ perspecti ve, the consequences of their self-percei ved
subjecti ve cogniti ve decline (f=8, n=6, 75% of patients) with
regard to psychosocial factors were most frequently reported
(f=36, n=8, 100% of patients), mainly involving psychological
distress (f=13, n=2, 25%), feelings of insecurity (f=6, n=3, 38%
of patients), depressi ve symptoms (f=2, n=2, 25% of patients),
or fear of repeated falls (f=3, n=1, 13% of patients):A really tedious thing is that you often can’t keep up.

T2: Treatment Experience and Preferences
Previous Treatment and Training Experiences
To counteract cogniti ve decline and preserv e physical
capabilities, mobility , and ADLs, patients have already been
on medical training therap y (MTT ; f=3, n=3, 38% of patients),
have already been on physical therap y (PT; f=2, n=2, 25% of
patients), have performed a specif ic group-based (ie, f=1, n=1,
13% of patients) or individual (f=1, n=1, 13% of patients)
cogniti ve training or meditation (f=1, n=1, 13% of patients), or
have reported to have no experience in any specif ic therap y or
training (f=1, n=1, 13% of patients).
From the patient’ s viewpoint, MTT and PT were percei ved as
useful (f=3, n=3, 38% of patients), but patients reported that
they would have to do it more consistently to profit from it (f=2,
n=2, 25% of patients). Computerized cogniti ve training (CCT)
was also percei ved as useful (f=1, n=1, 13% of patients) and
reported to be challenging, fun, and enjoyable (f=2, n=2, 25%
of patients). Nonetheless, patients reported being insecure about
the effectiveness of CCT (f=2, n=2, 25% of patients):

RenderX[In response to PT] [...]my gait has improved. I now
take slow and long steps and no longer fall over.
Howe ver, I would definitely have to do it more
consistently .[P-02]
The problem is primarily that my physical therapist
only has time for me every 14 days because she is so
book ed up. Of course, it would be nice if I could go
more often. But it is what it is, and I have to live with
it.[P-08]
[Patient explains game tasks of CCT] It’s not even
that simple . This is all fun and useful. But I don’t
know if it will do any good. [and] I have no intention
of stopping . Howe ver, at some point I have to ask
myself: “Does is go any further? Or is it just going
to stay at what I’m currently able to mana ge?”[P-01]
According to the experience of experts and health care
professionals, only cogniti ve forms of training or physical
exercises were often experienced as boring over time by older
adults with mNCD (f=2) and required guidance by a therapist
(f=2). More integrative forms of training, including gamified
tasks close to everyday life, multimodal animation, and acoustic
feedback, were reported to be preferred by patients (f=4):
It is often the case that patients are completely
dependent during strength training , [and] [...]the y
just kept on exercising and exercising . [...] They often
continue the exercises until you stop them. [E-10:
founder of an exergaming compan y]
Cognitive exercises including “a certain closeness to
everyday life and also a multimodal animation[...]
and acoustic feedbac k have been very well received. ”
[E-03: neuropsychologist]
Previous Experiences With Novel Technologies
Although being described as skeptical about the use of
technological devices, experts percei ved older adults with
mNCD as ready to use technological devices such as heart rate
monitors during training (f=9), if its usability is ensured:
Well I think using a sensor it’s not a problem if the
wear able is well designed. [E-01: exergaming
researcher]
Many people would certainly be okay with a Polar
chest strap, but a monitor to be worn at the wrist
would certainly be preferable. If people are told why
these sensor s are used and what they are measuring ,
it should be feasible with the chest sensor s as well. It
may be difficult with certain older ladies or
overweight individuals, but for the average individual
this should not be a problem. [E-03:
neuropsychologist]
The experts’ perceptions coincided with those of patients. All
patients were willing to use a heart rate monitor worn with a
chest strap during training, provided it was benef icial for their
training. In addition, 75% (6/8) of patients stated that their PC
or television was usable, whereas 25% (2/8) of patients reported
limited usability:[Regarding the use of heart rate monitor s during
training] [...]pr ovided it’s useful I would be ready to
wear such a heart rate monitor without having any
reservations at all.[P-01]
[About the usability of the television] Sure! All you
have to do is press the switc h. That’ s still possible .
[P-07]
[About the usability of the personal computer] Yes,
using my personal computer works more or less. [...]
It is just not something of my generation. I have a
computer and I use it, but there are always things I
can’t do and have to ask my granddaughter .[P-01]
Previous Experiences With Exer games [ “Senso (Flex)”
Specif ically]
None of the intervie wed patients reported any previous
experience with exergames in general or with the exergaming
system “Senso (Flex)” specif ically . Nonetheless, after a short
introduction to the system, all patients stated that they would
be willing to try it.
On the basis of the previous experiences of the experts and
health care professionals, the interaction with the “Senso, ” its
overall usability , and the design of the exergames have been
described as good (f=5). Regarding hardw are components, minor
usability problems have been reported. Patients were observ ed
to unintentionally walk off the middle plate without noticing
the feedback on the screen (f=4), constantly change their focus
between the game tasks on the screen and the stepping plate to
anticipate and plan their movements (f=4), or make too small
steps to tap on one of the outer stepping plates (f=1). In addition,
the patients needed time to familiarize themselv es with the
sensiti vity of the stepping plate (f=2):
[...]the “Senso” is in general well usable and is also
very often used. [E-04: exergaming researcher]
The tasks on the “Senso” are very well designed.
[E-08: project manager therap y]
[...]the “Senso” is already very user friendly , [but]
I had a little problem at the beginning of the
experiment wher e people would accidentally go out
of the squar e in the middle of the “Senso”. [E-09:
exergaming researcher]
Most of the time, the patients look down at that very
moment and thus do not see the messa ge [on the
screen] at all. [E-07: physical and occupational
therapist]
Additional usability issues were reported to be linked to the
capabilities of older adults with mNCD. First, it has been
described that patients are often cogniti vely overloaded when
trying out new games (f=1), by the occurrence of an unexpected
situation or technical errors (f=2), or by the cogniti ve task
demands required to interact with the exergame system in
general (f=1), which may limit training duration owing to
attentional exhaustion (f=2):
With new games, patients are often overwhelmed in
general, because they don’t know what to expect.

RenderXThey often need time to find their way around. [E-07:
physical and occupational therapist]
[...] Patients are completely overwhelmed as soon as
something unexpected or a technical problem occur s.
[E-03: neuropsychologist]
In contrast, the physical capabilities were reported to not directly
affect the usability of the system (f=4), although some patients
experienced difficulties with backw ard steps (f=2), and many
patients made use of the handrail to reduce the physical strain
(f=6). In some cases, physical limitations (eg, fatigue and joint
pain) resulting from static loading have been reported to limit
the training duration (f=4):
Patients often have problems with backwar d steps.
[and] Patients hold on to the handr ail far too often.
[...] it is often the case that people hold on because
it is simply ‘a bit more comfortable .[E-10: founder
of an exergaming compan y]
Often it is already difficult and tiring for patients to
stand for a longer period of time. It is often easier for
them to walk. [and] Howe ver, it should be noted that
this form of fatigue is not necessarily compar able to
fatigue caused by physical training . Fatigue does not
necessarily come from physical exertion. It is possible
that this type of fatigue is caused by the static load
and the resulting joint pain. [E-06: physical and
occupational therapist]
When considering the specif ic games of the exergaming device
“Senso” (video illustrations and explanations of all currently
available games can be found at [71]), the simple and clear
design structures of the games (f=4) and the intuiti ve tasks were
reported to be highly appreciated by patients and promote good
comprehensibility , which was reported for the games “Simple”
(f=3), “Birds” (f=3). Nonetheless, there are also games that
were reported to cause problems of understanding, in particular
the games “Simon” (f=3), “Tetris” (f=3), “Habitats” (f=4),
“Targets” (f=1), and “Snak e” (f=2). These problems may be
related to the game instructions (f=9):
[...]Many people are very happy with simple design
structur es. This should be maintained at all costs
when designing new games for MCI patients.
Howe ver, [...]some kind of adjustment of the game
instructions is definitely needed. [E-10: founder of
an exergaming compan y]
For patients, a game does not stand out by its great
graphics, but by the game tasks as such.[E-08: project
manager therap y]
[About problems of under standing the games] I think
the reasons were that they didn’ t really under stand
the instructions well. [E-09: exergaming researcher]
However, it could also be related to the task demands of the
games. It was reported that the patients need some time to
familiarize themselv es with the game to fully understand it
(f=1). According to the experts’ experiences, this works well
with the games “Simple” (f=4), “Birds” (f=1), “Flexi” (f=1),
and in some cases “Habitats” (f=1). At the same time, games
such as “Flexi” (f=1), “Habitats” (f=6), “Hexagon” (f=3),“Simon” (f=6), “Ski” (f=4), “Targets” (f=12), and “Tetris” (f=4)
were frequently reported to start at an already (too) challenging
level for older adults with mNCD and progress too fast while
there is a limited range of games or adaptability of task demands
at the lower end of difficulty levels (f=9). This was mentioned
to be mainly apparent for the cogniti ve task demands (eg, game
speed and task comple xity), whereas physical exercise intensity
is often (too) low and could be increased (f=4):
For MCI-patients, some games are predestined to be
used with them, such as “Simple ,” “Flexi,” “Birds”
and perhaps also “Habitats. ” These games don’t put
so much time pressur e and the feeling of having
missed something on patients. [E-08: project manager
therap y]
[...]the increase in the challeng e profile from the
easiest games (“Simple” and “Birds”) to the next
more difficult game is too steep for MCI-patients. For
example , the game “Targets” is too fast for many
patients. The game “Habitats” contains too many
stimuli at once , so that the patients no longer know
what they have to pay attention to.[E-07: physical
and occupational therapist]
[...]I have the impression that the internal
progression, which is responsible for adapting the
game demand, sets the lower limit too high and adapts
too quickly, so that the cognitive overload becomes
visible very quickly, especially in MCI-patients. [E-08:
project manager therap y]
One problem with the “Senso, ” in general, is that the
physical intensity might well be higher .[E-05:
neuropsychologist]
Overwhelming task demands may cause frustration or refusal
of games (f=6), although the feedback mechanisms to indicate
errors work subtle (f=4). In contrast, games that are percei ved
as being too easy lead to boredom (f=2):
For example , the games “Targets,” “Ski” or
“Hexagon” are very confr onting , and patients
recognized quite quick: “Okay , I can’t do it,” and
that frustr ates patients. [...] Usually , these patients
stop in the middle and say something like: “Ah, I
don’t need that kind of shit.” Most of the time, they
stop the training session immediately and don’t want
to continue anymor e.[E-08: project manager therap y]
My observation was that the negative feedbac k
currently used does not demotivate the patients at all.
It is also clear to the patients that they need to know
when they are making mistak es and whether they are
completing the tasks correctly.[E-04: exergaming
researcher]
Some of the negative feedbac k is so subtle that it is
not even noticed. [E-05: neuropsychologist]
T3: Motivators for Training
The experts described numerous motivators for training older
adults with mNCD. The most frequently described motivators
can be classif ied as intrinsically regulated motivators (f=44),
which are directly related to exergames. Excitement, enjoyment,
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 8 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616
(page number not for citation purposes)Manser et al JMIR SERIOUS GAMES
XSL•FO
RenderXor fun is percei ved as a central motivator for performing
exergames (f=4). This was reported to be maintained by the
capti vating character of exergames (f=1) and multimodal
animation (f=1), which is supported by specif ic game
components (eg, game tasks or designs close to everyday life
[f=6] or with personal relations or memories [f=1] including
music or sound effects [f=8], animals or plants [f=4], landscapes
[n=1], or colors [f=1]). In addition, patients were described as
intrinsically motivated by gamification (f=6), the feeling of
being optimally challenged (n=3), or simply by the variation of
training (f=6):
For patients, the focus is primarily on having fun with
the games. For example , they [...]lik ed watching birds
and listening to birdsong and felt very motivated by
the personal connection. Through these personal
memories [...] a whole other level of motivation
emer ged.[E-08: project manager therap y]
I think that those people who enjoy playing games
are generally captur ed by the playful and competitive
natur e of the games. Furthermor e, training with
exergames is something completely different
compar ed to classical therapy. Patients appreciate
this chang e from the “dry” standar d therapy.[E-06:
physical and occupational therapist]
However, when task demands become too high (f=6) or too low
(f=2), patients have been observ ed to promptly lose their
willingness to perform the exergames, as already reported.
External motivators such as social support (eg, by therapists or
caregivers) or group dynamics have also been reported to
impro ve motivation to train (f=12). Feeling concerned about
cogniti ve deterioration or being confronted by performance
classif ications can either motivate or induce negative feelings
(f=7). Finally , some patients were also reported to be motivated
by the effectiveness of exergames (f=2) or performance
impro vements (f=2):
I consider this social support to be very centr al. [...]
If a relative joins in for motivation or support it can
be very valuable .[E-04: exergaming researcher]
I think there are always patients who don’t want to
know how well they are performing . Forcing
performance feedbac k on such people can of course
be motivating , but it could also be negative and
confirm their limitations. [E-07: physical and
occupational therapist]
From the patients’ viewpoint, all patients reported that they
could primarily be motivated to train regularly by the
effectiveness of the training, helping them achie ve their
individual success (f=13, n=8, 100%). Alternately , patients
reported being motivated by their relati ves or partners (f=2,
n=1, 13%) and enjoyment of exercising (f=1, n=1, 13%). Having
to travel to a training facility was reported to have a negative
effect on training motivation and adherence (f=4, n=1, 13%):
It would be nice if I could go for a walk in the forest
again without falling down. I used to do this four
times a week for 75 minutes. It motivates me to train
so that I can do this again in the futur e.[P-02]It would motivate me if I could improve my abilities
(balance) again. [...] I would like to stay independent
and modern, not to be called an old lady.[P-03]
The success. I no longer need to be motivated. If I set
my mind to it, I do it![P-08]
T4: Training Goals and Outcomes
Regarding the training goals, cogniti ve functioning (f=19)
should be targeted in the training interv ention in the experts’
viewpoint while also addressing ADLs and mobility (f=3),
addressing physical capabilities (f=3), and accounting for
psychosocial factors (f=2), such as feelings of insecurity .
However, the weighting of the training focus differs signif icantly
between experts in different fields:
[...] higher order processes (i.e. divided attention or
the ability to plan) are affected in most patients.
Therefore, it is important to focus on these higher
order cognitive functions. [E-05: neuropsychologist]
I think that the coupling of brain functions with
physical functions is centr al. At the same time [...]it
is important to focus on what is impair ed. If the
frontal lobe is impair ed, it is certainly important to
train executive functions, attention and inhibition.
[E-10: founder of an exergaming compan y]
Primarily physical activation, especially that people
get moving and walk. But also, to train the intuitive
way of taking steps. [...] The cognitive aspects of the
training have always played a subor dinate role for
me, but they were usually not decisive for the success
of the therapy, as this was often trained differently ,
and I am not an expert in this. [E-06: physical and
occupational therapist]
When asking experts about the training goals of patients, ADLs
and mobility (f=5) were the most frequently stated in addition
to cognition (f=3) and physical functioning (f=2). In addition,
psychosocial factors (f=2) have been reported to include
socializing or having fun:
I had patients who wanted to continue training
because the training made them more confident in
their gait. They felt better balance after the training .
[E-06: physical and occupational therapist]
The patients also see the cognitive aspects of the
training , of course. [...] We often explain to the
patients that falls prevention has a cognitive and
physical aspect and that these aspects interact.
Therefore, the patients mainly go to the training with
the aim of improving their gait. [E-07: physical and
occupational therapist]
Some people really know what’ s going on and they
know that they have a disease and that they can
prevent or slow down the progression by doing
physical activity and exergames. But then other s don’t
really know that they have cognitive deterior ation
and they’re just playing a game and having fun
without specif ic training goals. [E-09: exergaming
researcher]

RenderXThis is consistent with patients’ viewpoint who most frequently
reported impro ving gait (f=6, n=5, 50%), memory (f=3, n=3,
38%), and balance (f=2, n=2, 25%) as their primary goal to
increase their quality of life. In addition, patients reported being
more active (f=1, n=1, 13%), increased functional abilities (ie,
cooking; f=1, n=1, 13%), increased strength (f=1, n=1, 13%),
or remaining independent in ADLs (f=1, n=1, 13%) as training
goals:

affects a lot of other things. [P-01]

T5: Exergame and Training Components
Location
Regarding training location, the experts reported that the patients
would either prefer individual training at home (f=3) or in a
mixed setting, including training at home combined with training
at a clinic (f=4). None of the experts stated that patients would
prefer exercising at a clinic or training facility in general, as
this is often associated with excessi ve time expenditure. Training
at home was reported to be benef icial, because it represents a
known environment that makes patients feel more secure.
However, the experts also stated that patients may not be capable
of performing exercises or exergames independently and
therefore need guidance throughout each training session (f=4)
or at least partially (f=9); for example, when starting up the
system or in case of technical problems:
The advanta ge of training at home is that “it’s a
known environment and they feel safer at home and
also don’t have to travel.” Howe ver, “I would suggest
that the help of a guiding therapist with experience
will be necessary .”[E-09: exergaming researcher]
In a previous investigation [...], patients’ feedbac k
was that 70% could imagine doing the training from
home . [...] For MCI-P atients specif ically , relatives
may be involved. But in general, the need for
home-based exergame training is there, I would say.
[E-08: project manager therap y]
This is also reflected in the outcomes of the question of whether
patients would be capable of performing home-based exergame
training; the experts mainly reported that patients are certainly
capable (f=4) or should be capable of considering some concerns
(f=9) to perform such a training program independently at home.
The concerns that need to be considered include the
impro vement of game instructions (f=2), accessibility of a
handrail or similar for safety support (f=2), and avoidance of
technical problems (f=2) or the integration of a guided
familiarization period (f=1) or support of a care professional or
partner (f=2):I think if the system would really work properly then
you could use it at home . Howe ver, if you just have
some minor technical problems is already like a no-go
to use it at home at all.[E-01: exergaming researcher]
It would certainly be good if the patients could
complete an accompanied training for a certain
period of time in order to facilitate the transfer to
training at home .[E-04: exergaming researcher]
[...] some kind of adjustment of the instructions is
needed [...], especially for this patient group and for
independent training in the home-based setting . [...]
The instructions have to be adapted in such a way
that under standing can be achieved without someone
having to stand next to the patients all the time.[E-10:
founder of an exergaming compan y]
Of those patients who responded to the question and had a clear
preference regarding the training location, most (6/7, 86%)
patients would clearly prefer to train individually at home,
because it is less time consuming and more flexible. One patient
did not have a clear preference; she simply wanted to perform
the exercises where it was easiest for her and preferred group
exercises:
For me, it is important that the training can be done
independently at home . If I have to go to the doctor
some wher e every time, it’s simply too much work.
[P-01]
Preferably at home , if I can. Then I can also choose
the time when I want to exercise. I have lived my
whole life with a packed schedule . Now I want to be
a little freer and more flexible .[P-03]
Safety
The experts reported an increased risk for falls, as patients with
mNCD (1) are easily distractable and (2) have difficulties in
self-assessment and impaired planning abilities. Therefore, it
was recommended to use the handrail in the beginning to
minimize the risk of falls (f=3), which was also requested by 1
patient. In the case of a home-based exergaming system—which
may not have a handrail—thorough and clear safety instructions
are recommended (f=1):
Especially in the beginning , until the patients have
under stood what it is all about, it is very important
to instruct using the handr ail.[E-04: exergaming
researcher]
I definitely need a railing to prevent falls during
training . I often fall down if I don’t have anything to
hold on to.[P-02]
Instruction, Familiarization, and Guidance
As illustrated earlier , certain adaptations are required to enable
a more independent use of the exergaming device. First, patients
should be familiarized with the exergaming device and the
corresponding games considering the following key elements:
(1) start at an easy level (f=7), for example, by using the game
“Simple” (f=4), (2) ensure that patients voluntarily try out the
device (f=3), (3) ensure that you are not too confronting (f=2),
(4) give patients enough time to familiarize with the new task
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 10 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616

XSL•FO
RenderX(f=1), and (5) start with a reaction game, then progress to games
for specif ic domains of neurocogniti ve function (f=1):
It is very important to start very slowly and at a low
difficulty level until the patients can better assess their
abilities on the “Senso”. […] Since the game
“Simple” waits for a reaction from the individual, it
is very suitable to start with. [E-04: exergaming
researcher]
We always start with a reaction game so that the
patients can learn the coupling of the cognitive-motor
functions and learn to interact with the environment.
Later on, we focus on specif ic cognitive functions.
[E-10: founder of an exergaming compan y]
Regarding the instructions, some adjustments are needed to
impro ve comprehensibility . Currently , there is instructional text
before starting each game. However, patients with mNCD have
been reported to have limited comprehension of instructions.
Therefore, adaptations are needed in the instructions of
exergames in general and for a home-based exergaming system
in particular . The experts mainly suggested to use step-by-step
(f=3) instructions based on a combination of visual (ie, written
instruction or video demonstration) and verbal instructions (f=4)
guided by an experienced therapist (f=1). In case of more
severely impaired patients or for home-based exergaming
systems, it was suggested that practical demonstrations (f=2),
video instructions (f=6) or even interacti ve “trial run”
instructions (f=5) could impro ve comprehensibility of the games:
The transfer from the written instructions to the
under standing of what is to be done in the game is
sometimes difficult. [E-06: physical and occupational
therapist]
Personally , I would replace the written instructions
with a short (few seconds) video sequence showing
the most important functions of the games. [E-08:
project manager therap y]
I would recommend combining visual and verbal
instructions. For example , through a visual
presentation with additional step-by-step verbal
instructions. Verbally we can “pick up” the patients
very well and get a feeling whether the patients have
under stood the instructions. [E-03: neuropsychologist]
[...], some kind of adjustment of the instructions is
needed. [...] It is definitely important to pursue and
use these adaptations, especially for this patient group
and for independent training in the home-based
setting”, because “in the case of more severe
impairments, it is often necessary to demonstr ate the
games step by step by yourself. [...] In other gaming
systems there is a short test phase with explanations
and trial runs [...]. Howe ver, this would have to be
offered as an option, since most patients will no
longer need it after a few sessions. [E-10: founder of
an exergaming compan y]
Finally , when guiding patients through their training sessions,
social support and guidance by a care professional or partner
might be benef icial (f=3). However, it was also mentioned thatthis might be critical because of personal conflicts or patients’
psychological constraints (f=2):
Family member s could play an important role in
reminding and motivating patients to complete their
training .[E-06: physical and occupational therapist]
I don’t think it’s always a good idea to include family
member s as guidance , because the pressur e to
perform gets higher for the patients, since they try to
hide their impairments from other s. A health care
professional like a nurse for example or physical
therapists would be better than a husband or wife, I
think. They already have a lot of fights in the
households, because things are not working out as
they should. [E-09: exergaming researcher]
From a patient’ s perspecti ve, all patients reported that they can
imagine training alone, provided they had recei ved thorough
instructions and understood their tasks. One patient additionally
requested regular support from a care professional or partner:
Yes, I think so. Once I learn that, I’m sure I can do it
independently .[P-03]
If I am supported by you or by my partner , then I can
certainly train partly independently .[P-07]
Exer game System and Content
Previous experiences of older adults with mNCD using the
exergaming system “Senso” are illustrated earlier . Building on
this, several game-specif ic adaptations were suggested by the
experts (f=9):
More time should be provided between the balls so
that the flood of information is reduced (it is often
overwhelming when several balls are visible on the
screen very quickly). [E-07 (physical and occupational
therapist): for the game “Targets”]
In the initial phase , until patients’ have under stood
all the game tasks [...], the speed must definitely be
reduced. [E-06 (physical and occupational therapist):
for the game “Habitats”]
There are already enough opportunities to increase
the task difficulty . [...] Howe ver, it is very important
to note that the game difficulty is adjusted downwar ds
so that it is easier to start the training . [E-08: project
manager therap y]
In addition to these game-specif ic adaptations, multiple novel
game designs and elements have been suggested and discussed
by focus groups to address patients’ needs optimally . In general,
it has been recognized that there is a need for new games
specif ically targeting the neurocogniti ve functions of learning
and memory (f=4) and executi ve functions (ie, working memory
and cogniti ve inhibition; f=2). Specif ic game design suggestions
were discussed for such a memory or working memory game.
Additional suggestions for new game designs and elements
include the use of music, addition of visual reminders to guide
patients within the games, or adaptations in performance
feedback:
With the “Senso”, a certain spectrum of
neurocognitive function domains is covered. Howe ver,

RenderXgames for working memory , inhibition or memory are
completely missing . In the case of memory , there is
currently only one game available specif ically
targeting the training of short-term memory span.
[E-05: neuropsychologist]
I think music would be very motivating for people
with MCI or dementia also if is music from their youth
or music they like. It’s also been described in the
literature that music has so many good effects on
people when they have heard a song that they liked
befor e and they are singing that song.[E-09:
exergaming researcher]
In addition, it would be good to include reminder s,
for example at the edge of the screen, which patients
can use for orientation. [...] Additionally , [...] it would
certainly be helpful here if the program not only
displayed the performance curve , but also provided
a reason or explanation. [E-03: neuropsychologist]
As general requirements when designing new games, the experts
recommended using simple graphics and ensuring good contrast
(f=14), a comfortable relation, and good usability of the
exergames (f=4) using easily comprehensible and clearly
designed tasks (f=2) with a certain closeness to everyday life
(f=7). Multimodal animations, including multisensory feedback
(f=7), should additionally be integrated by focusing on positi ve
reinforcement mechanisms (f=2) to motivate the patients during
exergaming. In addition, it is important that the main task is in
the center of the screen (f=1) and that only elements that are
related to the game task are included (f=5). Moreo ver, too
confronting performance feedback (f=1) and unexpected
appearance or technical problems (f=2) should be avoided:
It is very important to create a good contr ast. [...]
It’s generally important for the older population to
keep the graphic representation as simple as possible ,
because for older people , the game is not
characterized by great graphics, but by the game task
as such. The main importance is that the right level
of challeng e is offered.[E-08: project manager
therap y]
It is much better to present a simple graphic and focus
on the aspects that need to be trained. [...]
unnecessary graphic gimmic ks should be avoided!
[E-04: exergaming researcher]
It is important to have a main action that is in the
center of the screen and to ensur e that the player will
have primary task in the center . If you put any
secondary tasks into the games, it can be confusing
for the patients. [E-02: exergaming researcher]
Spontaneously , I would say that games close to
everyday life are more popular . [...] These games
were much better received than abstr actly structur ed
games (“visual explor ation tasks”). [E-03:
neuropsychologist]
My experience so far is that games that are designed
to be more relevant to everyday life (and simpler)
work better . Therefore, new game designs should bebased on what patients know from their everyday
lives. [E-06: physical and occupational therapist]
Training Components
The recommended exercise frequenc y ranged from 2 (f=3) to
5 or more (f=4) training sessions per week, largely dependent
on training location and motivation. The recommended session
durations ranged from a maximum of 15 to 20 minutes (f=3)
up to 30 minutes (f=2), with the aim of reaching a moderate
exercise volume of approximately 150 minutes per week (f=1).
Shorter sessions and a higher training frequenc y have been
reported to be preferable to reach this training volume, mainly
owing to attentional exhaustion:
The more the better! I would prefer shorter training
sessions, especially because of attentional exhaustion.
Here I would recommend a maximum of 30 minutes
and at least 5 sessions a week. This is much better
than training for 2 hour s at a stretch![E-03:
neuropsychologist]
I would recommend a training frequency of 2 –
3x/week. [...] The training duration is difficult to
estimate . Some patients are already exhausted after
2 minutes, other s can easily train for 20 minutes.
[E-10: founder of an exergaming compan y]
I think that a training frequency of 3x/week is already
(too) much. 2x/week should be possible to arrange.
1x/week definitely works. This may be because three
appointments, in combination with other activities,
may already be too much for patients. If the training
could be done at home , the training frequency could
certainly be increased up to 4 - 5x/week. In this case,
motivation could still be difficult. [E-07: physical and
occupational therapist]
I would aim for a training volume of 150 min/week.
As far as I know , this is consider ed moder ate for older
patients. I would consider 100 min/week as the lower
limit. A minimum of 3 x per week for 30 min would
also be okay at best. [E-08: project manager therap y]
Exercises requiring a coupling of physical and cogniti ve
functions were described as preferable and should be prescribed
domain-specif ic depending on the patient’ s abilities:
I think that the coupling of brain functions with
physical functions is centr al. Whether this is
ultimately an attention game , or a training of the
executive functions is something I don’t consider
centr al at the beginning . Of course, it also plays a
role here which cognitive functions are impair ed. [...]
If the frontal lobe is impair ed, it is certainly important
to train executive functions, attention and inhibition.
[E-10: founder of an exergaming compan y]
To maintain the training program in the long term (preferably
>12 weeks), motivation is a key factor that can be facilitated
by the playful character of the exergames and a variation in the
choice of games. Nonetheless, patients seem to prefer a certain
routine:
Of course, the training should be maintained over a
certain amount of time at a stretch. So not just two
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 12 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616

XSL•FO
RenderXweeks, but ideally longer (mor e than 12 weeks). Of
course, motivation is also a very centr al point. If the
training is varied and has a playful character , this
should be feasible .[E-03: neuropsychologist]
Patients are generally routine-oriented, which can
also be observed in general. Therefore, it is also
important to introduce a new game every now and
then. The patients primarily prefer the familiar games
and should therefore be challeng ed to a certain
variety .[E-10: founder of an exergaming compan y]
The physical exercise intensity should be maintained at a light
to moderate level, while the focus should be on game comple xity
that should be challenging but feasible. Game comple xity can
be varied on multiple levels, for example, (1) stability support
(use of handrail with both hands, 1 hand, or no support), (2)
stepping direction, (3) game choice and tasks included, (4) game
duration, or (5) game speed:
Adding new games. I always start with the game
“Simple” and sometimes in the first session I also
introduced “Birds” when I think it would be possible .
If not, then I will do it the next session. If somebody
is really performing well and under standing all the
instructions, then I also progress to the game
“Targets” and even “Birds”. [E-09: exergaming
researcher]
I also often started with just stepping movements
forwar d [...] and included the step direction to the
right at a later timepoint. [E-10: founder of an
exergaming compan y]
We have a routine that we usually do the training
sessions over 3 weeks and do the first 3 sessions with
holding , just to get a feel for the games. After that,
we gradually go back to holding on with one arm and
without holding on.[E-08: project manager therap y]
From the patients’ viewpoint, a high training frequenc y (mean
preferred training frequenc y 5.21 times per week; n=7), ranging
from 2 times per week (n=1, 13%) to daily sessions (n=4, 50%))
with short session durations (mean preferred session duration
23.4, SD 10.3 minutes; n=8), ranging from 10 minutes (n=1,
13%) up to 30 minutes (n=3, 38%) was preferred. Five of 6
(83%) patients who responded to the questions about how long
they would prefer to do the training stated that they would prefer
to continue the training as long as they profit from it and are
able to do it. All patients preferred a training that is individually
adapted to apply moderate (4/5, 80% of patients) to high
physical (1/5, 20% of patients) intensity and moderate (3/5,
60% of patients) to high (2/5, 40% of patients) cogniti ve
challenges:
If the device was at home , I would do the training
every day.[P-01]
I don’t want to make a guarantee now, but I could do
a short training session every day for like 20 minutes
or so. But I can’t promise that I’ll do 40 minutes every
day, because I also want to do other things. Especially
when the weather is nice, I like to go outside . And
then I also must do the house work, which also takes
time.[P-03]I think about 30 minutes is good. If it goes on too long
or is too strict, then I get tired of it. I don’t like that.
That would be counterpr oductive .[P-05]
If I have the device, I could do this training forever.
As long as I still have the strength to do it.[P-02]
I would need a bit of a start-up period first. If it’s not
effective , I’ll stop again. Additionally , I don’t know
how my health will be in the futur e. But as long as
I’m reasonably fit, I’ll definitely want to do it.[P-07]
Individualization
Individualization of the exergame interv ention concept should
mainly account for two aspects: (1) task type (ie, choice of
exergames to individually focus on neurocogniti ve functioning;
f=4) and (2) task demands (ie, adapting the game demands
according to the individual capabilities to maintain a challenging
but feasible cogniti ve load; f=5). In addition, it was
recommended to change between games with different task
demands to enable the maintenance of attention over the entire
training duration (f=2) and to supervise training exertion (f=3):
It is important to have a system that will adapt the
games accor ding to the participant’ s performance .
[E-02: exergaming researcher]
The physical intensity is often not a problem, and it
should primarily be the comple xity of the training
that is individually adapted so that it is doable and
still has a certain physical demand. [E-10: founder
of an exergaming compan y]
[...] We also have to check whether somebody is very
fatigued [...]. Sometimes you have to let someone take
a rest because they will not always feel when they
have to take a rest.[E-09: exergaming researcher]
One should “[...]alternate between games that focus
primarily on performance and less on cognitive
aspects with more cognitively demanding games. ”

Discussion
Principal Findings
The objecti ve of this study was to determine the capabilities,
treatment preferences, and motivators for training older adults
with mNCD, as well as their perspecti ves on training goals,
settings, and requirements for exergames and training
components. This will—together and in line with a synthesis
of the optimal evidence-based informed decisions—serv e as
basis for user modeling, determination of therapeutic needs,
and definition of a set of requirements for the game design and
development process of a novel exergame-based training
concept. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
systematically and thoroughly investig ate user requirements
and preferences for an exergame-based training concept before
it is designed and developed specif ically for older adults with
mNCD based on these findings.
The results of our qualitati ve study , which included focus groups
with 10 experts or health care professionals and individual
semistructured, in-depth intervie ws with 8 older adults with

XSL•FO
RenderXmNCD, yielded the following key findings: (1—capabilities)
from a patients’ viewpoint, the psychosocial consequences of
their self-percei ved cogniti ve deteriorations might be more
burdensome than the cogniti ve changes themselv es;
(2—treatment preferences) more integrative forms of training
(such as exergaming) including gamified tasks close to everyday
life, multimodal animation, and acoustic feedback are preferred
by patients. None of the intervie wed patients reported any
previous experience with exergaming, but all patients described
the handling of different technologies as feasible despite some
challenges and were willing to try out exergaming;
(3—moti vators for training) from the expert’ s viewpoint, the
most frequently described motivators to train can be classif ied
as intrinsically regulated motivators such as excitement,
enjoyment, or fun in exercising that is maintained by the
capti vating character of exergames supported by specif ic game
components (eg, game tasks or designs close to everyday life
or with personal relations or memories including music or sound
effects, animals or plants, landscapes, or colors); the feeling of
being optimally challenged; and the variation of training. All
patients reported that they could primarily be motivated by the
effectiveness of the training, helping them to achie ve success
on an individual basis; (4—training goals and outcomes) the
most important training goals of older adults with mNCD
include impro vements in ADLs and mobility (gait and balance)
and memory , because these outcomes were described as central
to impro ving their quality of life; (5—e xergame and training
components) the use of home-based exergames as a form of
simultaneous-incorporated motor -cogniti ve training should be
prescribed with a domain-specif ic training focus depending on
a patient’ s cogniti ve abilities, a high training frequenc y (4-5
training sessions per week), short session durations (20-25
minutes), and individual adaption and progression of task type
and demands to reach a light to moderate level of physical
intensity and a challenging but feasible game comple xity. To
maintain the training program in the long term (preferably >12
weeks), motivation is a key factor and should be facilitated by
the playful character of the exergames, variation in the choice
of games, and ensuring that the patients are optimally
challenged. To make home-based training interv entions feasible,
multiple factors that need to be considered were identif ied.
Patient-friendly game instructions are needed, while the
accessibility of a handrail or similar for safety support,
avoidance of technical problems, and the integration of a guided
familiarization period or support from a care person need to be
ensured to make home-based exergame training feasible. As
general requirements for exergame design, simple graphics with
good contrast and easily comprehensible and clearly designed
tasks with a certain closeness to everyday life should be used.
Multimodal animations, including multisensory feedback that
focuses on positi ve reinforcement mechanisms, should be
integrated to motivate patients during exergaming. In addition,
it is important that the main task be in the center of the screen
and that only elements that are related to the game task are
included. Moreo ver, confronting performance feedback and
unexpected appearances or technical problems should be
avoided.Capabilities of Older Adults With mNCD
A variety of cogniti ve changes mainly affecting the
neurocogniti ve domains of learning and memory , comple x
attention, and executi ve function were discussed by the focus
groups and mentioned by the patients, whereas no serious
restrictions on physical capabilities, mobility , and ADLs were
reported. This is in line with DSM-5 [9]. According to the
definition of mNCD, modest (ie, for mNCD, performance
typically lies in the 1-2 SD range) deterioration in cogniti ve
functioning can be observ ed, whereas the capacity for
independence in everyday activities is preserv ed [9]. However,
from the patient’ s perspecti ve, the most prominent consequences
of their disorder were described as affecting psychological
factors, mainly by causing psychological distress, feelings of
insecurity , and depression. It is well known that depression and
anxiety are common in older adults with mNCD [72,73]. In
addition, patients with depression have higher rates of
conversion to dementia, indicating that depression is an
important risk factor for cogniti ve decline and progression to
dementia. This emphasizes the importance of assessing
depressi ve symptoms in older adults with mNCD [72].
Treatment Experience and Preferences
Most of the intervie wed patients had already gained experience
with different treatment or training approaches to counteract
cogniti ve decline and preserv e physical capabilities, mobility ,
and ADLs. Although MTT , physiotherap y, and CCT were
percei ved as useful, the patients reported being insecure about
the effectiveness of these approaches or that they would have
to (be able to) do it more consistently to profit from it, which
was described to be limited by the availability of therapists.
More integrative forms of training, including gamified tasks
close to everyday life, multimodal animation, and acoustic
feedback, were reported to be preferred by patients.
This is in line with the literature, showing that “research
involving older adults has found that CCT programs are
associated with high satisf action levels, and that they are also
a feasible option for individuals with MCI, with equal or better
adherence rates when compared with traditional cogniti ve
training ”[74-76]. This is also evident in the use of exergames.
Exergame-based training interv entions are widely accepted in
individuals with mNCD, and exergames increase or enhance
participants’ motivation to engage in rehabilitation activities
[40]. This is also reflected by the adherence rates to different
types of exercises in patients with mild to major NCD. Recent
systematic reviews and meta-analyses synthesized mean
adherence rates of 70% [77] for physical exercise interv entions,
whereas the mean adherence rate was higher for exergame-based
interv entions at 84% [78]. To the best of our knowledge, there
is no systematic review that has synthesized adherence rates to
CCT. However, Turunen et al [79] investig ated adherence to a
long-lasting multidomain CCT among a sample of 631 older
adults at risk of dementia. It was shown that only 20% of
participants completed at least half of their CCT sessions, and
only 12% of participants completed all (maximal number of
training sessions=144) of their training sessions. In addition,
37% of the participants did not train at all, whereas “previous
use of computers, better memory , being married/cohabiting,
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 14 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616

XSL•FO
RenderXand positi ve study expectations were independently associated
with the greater probability of starting the CCT. Previous
computer use was the main determinant of the number of CCTs
completed after the training was initiated ”[79]. Therefore, when
comparing these findings, it appears that exergame-based
interv entions have the highest adherence rates among different
training programs. This is consistent with findings in HOAs,
where adherence to technology-based training programs was
higher than that to traditional training programs, independent
of study site or level of supervision [80]. This finding may be
largely explained by the high level of enjoyment in using
technology-based physical exercise programs [80].
Technology-based training systems offer several advantages
over traditional training programs that may contrib ute to a more
enjoyable exercise experience. For example, exergames can
provide real-time feedback and positi ve reinforcement while
exercising and can monitor performance over time [80]. In
addition, exergames enable individual real-time adapti vity of
physical and cogniti ve task demands according to the
participants’ performance or physiological response (eg, heart
rate and brain activity), which is considered a key advantage of
serious video games (such as exergames) [81-83]. In fact, the
findings of our study suggest that applying an optimal challenge
is central to promote the use of exergames in patients with
mNCD in the long term.
When considering the experts’ previous experience in the use
of exergames (ie, “Senso”) with patients with mNCD, the
interaction with the device, its overall usability , and the design
of the exergames were described as good. Especially the simple
and clear game design structures were reported to be highly
appreciated by patients and to promote good task
comprehensibility . Various minor usability issues were reported,
including difficulties in the interaction with the exergame
training system “Senso” (eg, unintendingly walk off the middle
plate without noticing the feedback on the screen), but mainly ,
usability issues that related to capabilities of older adults with
mNCD (eg, limited comprehensibility of the game instructions)
were reported. These usability issues need to be considered and
addressed when developing a training concept specif ically for
older adults with mNCD. Nevertheless, it is important to
emphasize that these are only minor usability issues, and only
minor refinements are required to optimize the exergame
experience. This is also illustrated by recent studies showing
that exergame-based training programs using the “Senso” are
feasible; usable; and widely accepted in different populations
including community-dwelling older adults [84], geriatric
inpatients [51], and patients with major NCD [52], chronic
strok e [85], or multiple sclerosis [86]. Therefore, when designing
and developing an exergame-based training concept specif ically
for older adults with mNCD, these refinements should primarily
target the adaptability and individualization of task demands
and the optimization of the instruction of the exergames.
Moti vators for Training
The motivating factors most frequently described by experts
were classif ied as intrinsic motivators. These were described
as being maintained by the capti vating character of exergames
and promoted by specif ic game components such as game tasks
or designs close to everyday life or with a personal relation ormemory , including music or sound effects, animals or plants,
landscapes, or colors. In addition, patients were described to be
intrinsically motivated by gamification and the feeling of being
optimally challenged. From a patient’ s perspecti ve, the
effectiveness of the training, which helped them achie ve their
individual success, was clearly the most prominent motivator.
This is consistent with reports in the literature. More
autonomous forms of motivation can be promoted by various
factors, although these factors may vary depending on the
population. For example, a small case-control study compared
the motivational factors for using a balance exergame platform
between health y younger and older adults. It was shown that
“older adults were more intrinsically motivated by the joy of
playing and extrinsically motivated by the percei ved health
effects (physical and cogniti ve), with less regard for the in-game
rewards”[87]. To provide effective interv entions to promote
physical activity [88] in patient with NCDs, a new theoretical
model has recently been introduced. This theoretical model is
based on the review of existing theories that explain behavior
change in relation to physical activity in HOA, which were then
adapted and integrated to a new theoretical model called the
“PHYT in dementia” [88]. In this frame work, several additional
key elements for promoting behavioral changes in physical
activity have been proposed. These consist of self-ef ficacy,
including embarrassment (eg, supervision of activity had a
negative impact on engagement in the interv ention), personal
concerns (eg, fear of falling), and routine (eg, flexible integration
of physical activity interv ention into daily life regarding place
and time of performance), as well as appropriate challenges
[88]. A detailed awareness of participant motivators is required,
especially for the preference that the routine can be performed
at home and at different times during the day [88], because
self-determined motivation may be a central aspect of adherence
to home-based training programs [89].
Training Goals and Outcomes
The intervie wed experts recommended to mainly target cogniti ve
functioning when developing a training concept for older adults
with mNCD, while ADLs and mobility , physical capabilities,
and psychosocial factors should also be accounted for. This is
consistent with the patients’ viewpoint that most frequently
reported impro ving gait and memory as their primary training
goals to increase their quality of life.
Similar results have been documented in the literature.
According to a survey of patients who completed a
multicomponent behavioral interv ention for patients with MCI
and their caregivers, quality of life was the most important
outcome priority for patients with MCI, followed by
self-ef ficacy, depression, basic ADLs, memory-based ADL,
anxiety , and memory performance [90].
Exer game and Training Components
The use of exergames as a form of simultaneous-incorporated
motor -cogniti ve training is recommended, which should be
prescribed domain-specif ically , depending on a patient’ s
cogniti ve abilities. Previous studies applying exergame-based
motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with mNCD or MCI
have used commercially available exergame systems [76,91-96]
JMIR Serious Games 2023 | vol. 11 | e37616 | p. 15 https://g ames.jmir .org/2023/1/e37616

XSL•FO
RenderXor exergames that were specif ically developed for patients with
mNCD or MCI [97-100], which comprised sensor -based
stepping platforms [94], video camera–based or wireless remote
device systems [76,91,95,97,99], or exergames that were
controlled using a cycle ergometer or similar [92,93,96,98,100].
The training programs can be classif ied as simultaneous-
additional [92,93,96,98] or simultaneous-incorporated
[76,91,94,95,97,99,100] motor -cogniti ve training that was
applied targeting 1 [93,100] or multiple [76,91,92,94-99]
neurocogniti ve domains, including comple x attention
[76,91,92,94-99], executi ve functions [76,91,92,94-100],
learning and memory [91,93-95,97-99], or visuospatial skills
[76,97,99]. Only one of these studies applied training that
individually prescribed content on the basis of a patient’ s
cogniti ve abilities [96]. However, it has not been performed or
reported in a reproducible manner .
Therefore, so far and to the best of our knowledge, 11 studies
have been published that investig ated exergame-based
motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with mNCD or MCI.
Most of these studies designed or used exergames that could
be classif ied as simultaneous-incorporated motor -cogniti ve
training. Incorporating cogniti ve tasks into motor tasks may be
more benef icial for consolidating neuroplasticity [42], because
(1) it leads to greater (motor) cogniti ve impro vements, (2) it is
closer to daily life situations, (3) no prioritization effects occur ,
which can be observ ed in motor -cogniti ve training with
additional cogniti ve tasks, and (4) multiple sensory systems are
stimulated at the same time, which may provide an optimal
basis for cogniti ve processes such as learning [42]. Meta-analytic
evidence suggests that simultaneous motor -cogniti ve training
is the most effective type of training for impro ving cognition
in HOA [43,44] and in older adults with mNCD [44-46].
Nevertheless, it remains to be evaluated whether the
incorporation of cogniti ve tasks into exercise or training
interv entions indeed results in more distinct effects on cogniti ve
performance compared with simultaneous motor -cogniti ve
training with a non–task-rele vant secondary cogniti ve task [42].
Finally , there seems to be room for impro vement regarding the
domain-specif ic prescription of the training content, considering
a patient’ s cogniti ve abilities and the adaptation and
development of exergames specif ically for patients with mNCD.
This may be especially relevant when considering the large
heterogeneity in the clinical symptoms of older adults with
mNCD. Remarkably , most previous studies applying
exergame-based motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with
mNCD or MCI have used commercially available exergame
systems [76,91-96], in which the training content does not
specif ically target patients with mNCD. This is consistent with
the findings of HOA. In a systematic review, Valenzuela et al
[80] emphasized that in HOA, most studies used commercially
available exergame systems. It was argued that these systems
may be difficult to use for those with little or no experience
with technology , because these systems often lack clear
instructions, present too much graphical information, and have
not been designed and developed to provide optimal training
components for the target population and aims of the studies in
which they were used [80]. In fact, all previous studies applying
exergame-based motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with
mNCD or MCI have used exergames with comple x 2D or 3Dvirtual environments [76,91-100]. This may not be optimal
because the limitation that such systems may be difficult to use
for those with little or no experience with technology could be
even more pronounced in patients with mNCD, as these patients
are easily distracted and quickly overwhelmed by the task
demands. Indeed, according to the recommendations of the
intervie wed experts, it is benef icial to focus on the aspects that
need to be worked on by implementing easily comprehensible
and clearly designed exergame tasks and to only present
elements that are directly related to the game tasks while
avoiding unnecessary graphical information or distractors.
According to the recommendations of the intervie wed experts,
the training program should be maintained over the long term
(preferably ≥12 weeks). A training frequenc y of 2 to 5 or more
training sessions per week was recommended, largely depending
on the training location and motivation. In addition, it is
recommended to reach a moderate training volume of
approximately 150 minutes per week. To reach this training
volume, shorter training sessions and a higher training frequenc y
should be applied, because longer training sessions might lead
to attentional exhaustion in this group of patients. Therefore,
the experts recommended session durations between 15 and 20
minutes up to a maximum of 30 minutes. Previous studies
applying exergame-based motor -cogniti ve training in older
adults with mNCD or MCI have prescribed training programs
over durations of 5 weeks [97], 6 weeks [91,94,98,100], 12
weeks [96,99], 3 months [93,95], 24 weeks [76], or 6 months
[92]. The prescribed training frequenc y was 1 time per week
[76], 2 times per week [94,96,99], 2 to 3 times per week [95],
3 times per week [97,98], 3 to 5 times per week [92,93,100], or
5 times per week [91] with session durations of 15 minutes [99],
18 to 30 minutes [94], 20 to 80 minutes [97], 25 to 30 minutes
[91], 20 to 40 minutes [93], 30 to 45 minutes [100], 40 to 45
minutes [98], 45 minutes [92], 60 minutes [96], 90 minutes [76],
or not reported [95], resulting in a weekly training volume of
30 minutes [99], 36 to 60 minutes [94], 60 to 200 minutes [93],
90 minutes [76], 90 to 225 minutes [100], 100 to 145 minutes
[97], 120 minutes [96], 120 to 135 minutes [98], 125 to 150
minutes [91], 135 to 225 minutes [92], or not reported [95].
Therefore, most of these studies prescribed a training volume
that was in line with the recommendations of the experts in this
study . However, the session durations often exceeded the
experts’  recommendations, whereas the training frequenc y was
lower than recommended. To avoid attentional exhaustion of
the patients during training, future training concepts might
consider prescribing shorter session durations while increasing
the training frequenc y to achie ve a similar training volume per
week. This might actually impro ve the effectiveness of the
interv ention because higher training frequencies have already
been shown to promote the effectiveness of physical (ie, ≥4
times per week) [101] and cogniti ve training (ie, >3 times per
week) [102], while shorter session durations (ie, ≤30 minutes)
[101] of physical exercise have been shown to exert more
pronounced training effects. These findings might also apply
to simultaneous motor -cogniti ve training. A meta-analysis
revealed that training frequenc y is a signif icant moderator of
the effects of physical and motor -cogniti ve training interv entions
on cogniti ve functioning, favoring higher training frequencies
(≥5 times per week) in a mixed population of HOA and patients

RenderXwith mNCD [103]. Finally , a high training frequenc y
(approximately 5 times per week) with short session durations
(approximately 20 minutes) would also match the preferences
of the intervie wed patients in this study .
The experts reported that the training should preferably be
individually carried out at the patients’ homes, not only because
it represents a known environment that makes patients feel more
secure and represents a less-confronting environment for them
(because they do not have to hide their impairments from others
when training alone), but also to allow higher training
frequencies. Nonetheless, to ensure that training in patients’
homes is feasible, multiple factors need to be considered. For
example, impro vements in game instructions are required, a
handrail or similar needs to be made available to allow safety
support during training, and technical problems must be avoided.
In addition, a guided familiarization period and part-time
supervision or support from a care professional or partner should
be integrated to make the transfer to home-based exergaming
easier . Previous studies applying exergame-based
motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with mNCD or MCI
have administered individual [91] or group-based [76,96,99]
training sessions, and the training setting (ie, individual vs group
sessions) has not been clearly reported [92-95,97,98,100]. The
training sessions were conducted at the hospital [91], in a
nursing home [94], at day-care centers or memory clinics [99],
at a centrally located church [76], at patients’ homes [93,100],
or the training location was not clearly reported [92,95-98]. The
training sessions were supervised by a therapist [91,94,96], or
supervision was not reported [76,92,93,95,97-100]. Consistent
with summarized previous studies applying exergame-based
motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with mNCD or MCI,
most cogniti ve training programs to date have also been
conducted in group sessions [104]. However, most of our
intervie wed patients clearly stated that they would prefer to
train individually at home or with the support of a care
professional or partner . Therefore, it might be worthwhile to
put more effort into designing and developing exergames that
can be used individually at home. This would possibly also
reduce the barriers of patients with mNCD to engage in
exergame-based training programs in the long term.
Regarding training demands, the experts recommended focusing
on game comple xity to ensure a challenging but feasible
cogniti ve demand. Physical exercise intensity should be
maintained at a light to moderate level. To allow
individualization of the cogniti ve demand in training, two main
aspects should be considered: (1) task type (ie, choice of
exergames to individually focus on neurocogniti ve functioning)
and (2) task demands. To allow individualization of task
demands, the following factors should be varied based on the
experts’ recommendations: (1) stability support (use of handrail
with both hands, one hand, or no support), (2) stepping direction,
(3) game choice and tasks included, (4) game duration, or (5)
game speed. Previous studies applying exergame-based
motor -cogniti ve training in older adults with mNCD or MCI
have applied relati vely effortful, high cogniti ve demands [92],
low [97] to moderate [96-98] physical exercise intensities, or
have not reported the physical [76,91-95,99,100] or cogniti ve
[76,91,93-100] exercise load or training progression in a clearlyreproducible way. This exemplif ies the fact that the optimal
cogniti ve load for motor -cogniti ve training remains unkno wn.
To the best of our knowledge, there has only been 1
meta-analysis to date that compared the effects of training
interv entions on cogniti ve functioning in relation to different
task comple xities and found no difference between simple and
comple x cogniti ve games [105]. Therefore, further investigations
are needed to identify the optimal cogniti ve training demands
and optimize the monitoring and progression of training
programs. For physical exercise intensity , the recommendations
of the intervie wed experts are in line with those of previous
studies applying exergame-based motor -cogniti ve training in
older adults with mNCD or MCI. This also matches the analysis
of the moderating variables of the training parameters that
influence the effectiveness of the interv entions. Based on
meta-analytic results from motor -cogniti ve training in older
adults with mNCD, moderate physical training intensity [45]
has been shown to be most effective in impro ving cogniti ve
function. Finally , moderate physical exercise intensity would
also match the preferences of the patients intervie wed in this
study .
Implications for Resear ch
Our findings serve as a basis for user modeling, determination
of therapeutic needs, and definition of a set of requirements for
the game design and development of novel exergame-based
training concepts. To increase the probability that the resulting
training will be deemed feasible in future clinical practice, these
considerations should be integrated to guide the decision process
for the most suitable exergame design and interv ention
components when developing novel exergames and
exergame-based training concepts.
Limitations
The outcomes of this qualitati ve study must be interpreted with
some caution, considering the following limitations. First, none
of the intervie wed patients with mNCD belonged to the clinical
subtypes of mild frontotemporal NCD or mNCD with Lewy
bodies. Depending on the clinical subtypes and the associated
clinical pictures of the patients, different findings may have
emer ged from patient intervie ws. However, a substantial fraction
(ie, ≥60%) of mild or major NCD is attrib utable to Alzheimer
disease, whereas mild vascular NCD is the second most common
cause of NCD after Alzheimer disease; frontotemporal NCD
only accounts for approximately 5% of cases [9]. Therefore,
the included study population appeared to be representati ve of
these clinical subtypes. Second, owing to difficulties in
recruiting patients, those screened for MCI according to
predef ined criteria were recruited in addition to patients with a
clinical diagnosis of mNCD, which increased the heterogeneity
of the study population. By contrast, in our project, we aimed
to develop an individualized exergame-based training concept
not only to treat clinically diagnosed patients with mNCD but
also to prevent progression to dementia in individuals at risk
who might not have been diagnosed (yet). Third, owing to the
COVID-19 pandemic, all focus group sessions were held as
web-based meetings. Face-to-f ace focus group sessions might
have promoted livelier exchanges and may have led to additional
insights.

RenderXConclusions
The psychosocial consequences of patients’ self-percei ved
cogniti ve deterioration may be more burdensome than the
cogniti ve changes themselv es. Older adults with mNCD prefer
integrative forms of training (such as exergaming) and are
primarily motivated by enjoyment or fun in exercising and the
effectiveness of the training. Putting the synthesized perspecti vesof training goals, settings, and requirements for exergames and
training components into conte xt, our considerations point to
opportunities for impro vement in research and rehabilitation,
either by adapting existing exergames to patients with mNCD
or by developing novel exergames and exergame-based training
concepts specif ically tailored to meet patient requirements and
needs.

discussions by providing a contact list of experts and health care professionals, as the compan y is well connected with institutions
for geriatric populations, physiotherapies, and rehabilitation clinics in Switzerland. Therefore, we were able to identify experts
and health care professionals who experienced exergame training with older adults with mild neurocogniti ve disorder . Experience
was preferred with the exergame training system “Senso (Flex)” or similar . In addition, the founder of Dividat AG was partaking
in one of the focus group discussions as an industry representati ve in line with the Multidisciplinary Iterati ve Design of Exergames
frame work. Dividat AG had no other role in the study and did not play any role in the design and conduct of the study; they also
did not play any role in the data analyses, interpretation, or decision to submit results.
